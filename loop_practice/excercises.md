# Excerises for loop usage.

In all excercises use input() function to let your programms accept data from user.

```
1. Using a loop create a list that contains only even numbers that has 5 in it from range given by user 
(for example 150 will be in that list, but 105 will not). 
Programm asks user to give a start and end range values.

2. Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.
Sample List: datalist = [1452, 11.23, 1+2j, True, 'w3resource', (0, -1), [5, 12], {"class":'V', "section":'A'}]

Sample output: 
Type of  1452  is  <class 'int'>
Type of  11.23  is  <class 'float'> 
etc.

3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from given by user ranges. 
For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output:
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz

4. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
Sample Data: Python 3.2
Sample Output:
Letters 6
Digits 2
```
