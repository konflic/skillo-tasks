# Excerises for loop usage.

```
1. Using a loop create a list that contains only even numbers that has 5 in it from range 1 up to 1000 (for example 150 will be in that list, but 105 will not).

2. Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.
Sample List: datalist = [1452, 11.23, 1+2j, True, 'w3resource', (0, -1), [5, 12], {"class":'V', "section":'A'}]

Sample output: 
Type of  1452  is  <class 'int'>
Type of  11.23  is  <class 'float'> 
etc.

3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output:
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz

4. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. Go to the editor
Sample Data: Python 3.2
Sample Output:
Letters 6
Digits 2

Use input() function to let your programms accept data from user.
