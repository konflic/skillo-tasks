# Practice Session for OOP

## Animals

Create hierarchy of classes tha

## Temperature class

Create a Temperature class that is initialized by celsius or by farenheight of by kelvin value, and then makes other temperatures available as attributes.

It should not be possible to set value of temperature below absolute zero!

After creating an instance of class Temperature it should not be possible to change any attributes.

```python
temp_1 = Temperature(celsius=37.0)
temp_2 = Temperature(fahrenheit=98.6)

print(temp_1.fahrenheit) -> 98.6
print(temp_2.celsius) -> 37.0
print(temp_1.kelvin) -> 310.15
print(temp_2.kelvin) -> 310.15
```

## Deck of cards 

Create a Deck of cards class. Internally, the deck of cards should use another class, a Card class. 

Your requirements are:

- On creating new instance of Deck it should fill itself with 52 Cards.
- The Deck class should have a *deal* method to deal a single card from the deck.
- After a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck and returned.
- There should be a *shuffle* method which rearranges Cards within Deck randomly (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_shuffle.asp)
- There should be a *cards_left* property that returns how many cards left within Deck. 
- The Card class should have a suit [(Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade)](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/600179-gambling-and-symbols-on-various-cards-heart-diamonds-club-and-spade) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
- When deck is empty, it should return None on calling *deal* method.
